    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    This study provides causal estimates of the effect of air pollution on workplace safety using data on the universe of work accidents reported in Spain (2010-2019). We focus on a near-worldwide natural source of air pollution: mineral dust precipitation. Our estimates reveal dust precipitation marginal effects and overall burden on workplace safety are of the same order of magnitude as those of high temperatures. Impacts are widespread, spanning most worker and accident characteristics, and consistent with dust inducing human error across diverse tasks and activities. However, we find null effects for workers at the top quintile of the wage distribution.

    <summary> Abstract </summary>
This paper analyzes the impact of a recruitment policy aimed at improving the quality of new teachers. The reform introduced a scholarship to incentivize the enrollment of high-achieving high school graduates in teacher training programs and imposed enrollment restrictions on low-achieving high school graduates. The screening device used to define achievement was the national standardized university entry exam. Using rich administrative data, we document that the reform was effective in improving the average test scores of new teachers, especially in public schools. To assess the impact of the reform on teacher quality, we construct teacher value-added (TVA) measures based on standardized test scores of their pupils. Our findings indicate that the reform led to a significant increase in the TVA of mathematics teachers, equivalent to 30\% of their standard deviation. However, it did not affect the average TVA of Spanish teachers. We provide evidence that this heterogeneity across subjects can be explained by differences in the predictive power of test scores on teacher quality. Finally, we show that the increase in average teacher quality cannot be explained solely by the higher presence of high-achieving teachers.

**From Free to Fee: How Allowance Allocation Affects ETS Performance** <br>

    <summary> Abstract </summary>
This study provides causal firm-level estimates of the effect of a reduction in free emission allowances in emission trading systems on emissions and economic performance. We study an EU ETS reform that withdrew the right of some manufacturing firms to receive most emission allowances for free, exploiting this change in a difference-in-differences setting. We find that paying for allowances decreased emissions by more than 11 percent overall, relative to firms that retained free allowances. This reduction was accompanied by a significant decrease in economic performance, including revenue, employment, and assets of a similar magnitude. Using a multi-product model, we show that our results can be rationalized through an extensive margin adjustment of firms.

## Work in Progress
**Temperature and Learning in Chile**

<details>
    <summary> Abstract </summary>
This paper examines the impact of extreme temperatures on learning outcomes, with a particular focus on students from low-income backgrounds. Using panel data from over 1.5 million Chilean students who took a standardized university entry exam, I demonstrate that hot but also cold days are especially detrimental to academic performance. Additionally, I analyze school attendance records for the entire population of Chilean pupils to explore potential mechanisms. The findings reveal that heat significantly increases school absences, suggesting that reduced attendance may partially explain the negative effect of heat on learning outcomes. However, the adverse impact of cold days appears to operate through channels other than attendance.
