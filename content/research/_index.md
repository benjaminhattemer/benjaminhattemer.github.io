    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    This study offers novel causal estimates of the effect of air pollution on workplace accidents. We focus on a near world-wide natural source of air pollution: dust precipitation. We use administrative data on the universe of work accidents reported in Spain. Our estimates imply that an average day of dust precipitation induces a 1.2 percent increase in work accidents. We find these effects are pervasive for workers of different occupations, income levels and demographic characteristics. We also provide evidence supporting temporary impairment of physical and cognitive performance as the main causal channel.

    <summary> Abstract </summary>
This paper analyzes the impact of a recruitment policy aimed at improving the quality of new teachers. The reform introduced a scholarship to incentivize the enrollment of high-achieving high school graduates in teacher training programs and imposed enrollment restrictions on low-achieving high school graduates. The screening device used to define achievement was the national standardized university entry exam. Using rich administrative data, we document that the reform was effective in improving the average test scores of new teachers, especially in public schools. To assess the impact of the reform on teacher quality, we construct teacher value-added (TVA) measures based on standardized test scores of their pupils. Our findings indicate that the reform led to a significant increase in the TVA of mathematics teachers, equivalent to 30\% of their standard deviation. However, it did not affect the average TVA of Spanish teachers. We provide evidence that this heterogeneity across subjects can be explained by differences in the predictive power of test scores on teacher quality. Finally, we show that the increase in average teacher quality cannot be explained solely by the higher presence of high-achieving teachers.

**Temperature and Learning in Chile**
<details>
    <summary> Abstract </summary>
This paper demonstrates that extreme temperatures negatively affect learning outcomes, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds. Using panel data of school averages from more than one and a half million students in Chile taking a standardized university entry exam, I show that cold days are particularly damaging. By looking at school attendance data for the whole population of Chilean pupils, 
I examine school absence as a potential impact channel. Results show that heat significantly increases school absence. Lower school attendance can, therefore, explain decreased learning outcomes due to heat, but not for the measured impact due to cold days.
